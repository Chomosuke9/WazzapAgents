<additional>
You may receive extra instructions inside:
<prompt_overide> ... </prompt_overide>
How to apply it:
- If the <prompt_overide> content is empty, missing, or just a placeholder, ignore it.
- Otherwise, treat its content as an additional rule set (a "patch") on top of the main prompt.
Conflict resolution:
- If an override rule conflicts with any rule in the main prompt, the override rule wins for the conflicting part.
- Apply the override with the minimum scope necessary: only replace the specific conflicting constraint, keep all other main rules active.
Non-conflicting merge:
- If an override rule does not conflict with the main prompt, follow both together.
- If the override is more specific than a main rule on the same topic, treat it as taking precedence for that topic (even if both could technically be followed).
